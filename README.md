> Business Economics


I am a current student at UC Riverside studying Business Economics. I was born and raised in Vietnam but moved to the United States first at Raleigh, North Carolina for three years then later on to Orange County, California where I currently live. From a young age I have always shown an interest in the STEM field as I loved Science and Mathematics, that love only grew in High School when I found a real passion in Economics which then I chose to pursue here at UC Riverside.  
  
I chose UC Riverside because I was attracted to the honors program offered here, which allowed me to have certain advantages like priority registration and more engagement with faculty members. In addition, I really liked the Business Economic Major here at UC Riverside because it guarantees me to graduate in four years with a set straight plan of classes I have to take. Furthermore, coming to UC Riverside was an eye opening experience as I expose to a diverse campus filled with people of different backgrounds.  
  
Some of my interests are hanging out with friends, playing sports, and listening to music on my downtime. In addition, I am currently an employee at PACSUN down at the Tyler Mall in Riverside. I also enjoy playing video games such as Fortnite, FIFA, and NBA2k. Lastly, I also enjoy thrifting for cool old vintage clothes at places such pawn shops or, my personal favorite, The Rose Bowl Flea Market.
